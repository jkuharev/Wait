# Wait command

## Description
The wait command will allow to delay execution of external processes
on command line, e.g. from batch / bash scripts

## Motivation
There are plenty "standard" methods to delay command line execution
like using SLEEP, PAUSE or TIMEOUT commands or even obusing PING.
All of them did not work appropriately in a batch file that
was executed in a background / service process in Windows environment.

This one worked!

## Build
### C#
See Microsoft's documents on compiling C# programmes and compile
wait.cs to wait.exe

## Usage
wait <NumberOfSeconds>
